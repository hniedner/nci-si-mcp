# NCI SI MCP acceptance suite

The behavioural acceptance suite for the NCI SI MCP tools, which tests the requirements of the
[specification](../docs/specification.md), and the upstream fixture server it runs against. It tests the MCP
tool surface of a server it starts as a command or of a remote one it connects to; it knows
nothing of the server's code.

From the repository root:

```bash
pdm run acceptance --report=fixture.json             # fixture mode; writes acceptance/fixture.json
NCI_SI_ACCEPTANCE_MODE=live pdm run acceptance --report=live.json  # live-capable tests
NCI_SI_ACCEPTANCE_SERVER="..." pdm run acceptance    # another server (default: nci-si-mcp serve)
NCI_SI_ACCEPTANCE_URL=https://... pdm run acceptance # a remote server over streamable HTTP (below)
NCI_SI_ACCEPTANCE_PROFILE=evs NCI_SI_ACCEPTANCE_SERVER="..." pdm run acceptance  # a server of one profile (default: unified)
pdm run python -m nci_si_acceptance.report acceptance/fixture.json --live acceptance/live.json
pdm run acceptance-index-codes                       # the index set, one code per line (remote server)
pdm run acceptance -n 4 --report=fixture.json        # the same on four workers; the report is identical
pdm run acceptance-expected check acceptance/fixture.json   # a report against the expected outcomes
pdm run acceptance-expected update acceptance/fixture.json  # rewrite the expected outcomes from a report
pdm run acceptance-status                            # regenerate the README's status table
pdm run acceptance-selftest                          # the harness's own tests
SELFTEST_SHARD=1/3 pdm run acceptance-selftest       # one of three shards, as CI runs them
pdm run acceptance-record                            # re-record fixtures/recorded/ from live
pdm run acceptance-craft                             # rebuild the crafted scenarios
pdm run acceptance-register                          # regenerate request-forms/ from the manifest
pdm run acceptance-stories                           # regenerate the complete domain story catalogue
pdm run acceptance-stories --check                   # verify its mapping and generated content
pdm run spec-render                                  # regenerate docs/specification.md from spec/
```

## Writing a test

To read the behaviours without starting with Python, use these views:

| Reader's question | Where to look |
|---|---|
| Why does this behaviour matter to a domain user? | [Complete user-story catalogue](../docs/behavioural-tests.md), covering every collected MCP acceptance case |
| What must a caller observe, and which tests check it? | [Requirements and test citations](../docs/specification.md#4-requirements), generated from `spec/` and collected tests |
| What upstream situation does a fixture simulate? | Scenario sections in the [EVS](request-forms/evs.md#scenarios), [caDSR](request-forms/cadsr.md#scenarios) and [Shared SI](request-forms/ssis.md#scenarios) request registers |
| How do tools compose into a user task? | [Workflow tools and prompts](../docs/specification.md#workflow-tools) |
| What passed in a particular run? | [The acceptance report](#the-report), with per-tool counts; its JSON retains individual test outcomes |

The story catalogue groups related tests under a user goal and Given/When/Then narrative.
Each test function has an authored behaviour description in [`stories.yaml`](stories.yaml);
the renderer collects every parameter variant and its requirement citations from pytest.
Expandable evidence lists every exact case. The fixture register separately describes
upstream conditions. Implementation unit tests and harness self-tests are outside this MCP
catalogue.

When adding or renaming a test function, add or update its explicit assignment and description
in `stories.yaml`. Review the narrative when changing an existing test's behaviour. Run
`pdm run acceptance-stories` after changing tests, parameter variants, citations or narratives;
do not edit the generated guide. The harness self-tests check fresh collection against the
mapping and document, rejecting undocumented functions, stale references, duplicate assignments,
missing narrative fields and stale generated content. Collection runs no server or test.

A test calls a required tool by its name, `tools.call("get_concept", {...})`, and names the tool
it is for with `@pytest.mark.tool("get_concept")`; a gate, which fails every tool's verdict (the
P and X-25–X-28 requirements), is marked `gate`.
Every test carries one of the two, or collection refuses the run. A gate that cannot
run leaves the module unaccepted, since acceptance needs every gate to pass. When the
server lacks that exact name, the test is skipped as NOT IMPLEMENTED. Calls and arguments
are sent unchanged; no prototype tool stands in for a required tool. Each test asserts only
what the specification says.

Each test also cites the requirements it enforces, `@pytest.mark.requirement("X-2")`, by their
ids in [`../spec/requirements.yaml`](../spec/requirements.yaml), the project's statement of the
behaviour the suite tests and the server implements. Every requirement is cited by a test or
planned in an issue; `selftests/test_requirements.py` fails otherwise, and on a test that cites
nothing or an unknown id. A citation may cover part of a requirement: `planned` stays until the
citing tests cover all of it. A test that never runs (skip, a true skipif, xfail) covers nothing.

The cross-cutting tests (`tests/test_crosscutting.py`) run against every tool that has a call
in `tests/calls.yaml`, and find a result's items where the tool's `items` in
[`../spec/tools.yaml`](../spec/tools.yaml) say. A tool joins them with those two entries.

`@pytest.mark.scenario("release/unknown")` serves the scenario's fixtures before the ordinary
ones, to a server process of its own started with the scenario's settings. A test that must
see the server ask upstream is marked `own_server`, for a server process of its own that no
earlier call can have filled a cache of. `tools.process` keeps what a test may need of the
server process: its standard error and data directory (`written()`, everything it wrote), and the
upstream requests it made while it started. A test marked
`live_capable` also runs in live mode, unless it selects a scenario; every other test runs
against fixtures only.

Live coverage has 46 marked cases out of 965; 45 can run live, since the retired-concept
scenario remains fixture-only. Alongside protocol, discovery, argument and cache checks,
content checks discover the current monthly NCIt release for concept identity, includes,
paths, maps, relationship catalogues and cross-domain CDE discovery. They check contracts
and matching release provenance, not historical names, counts or order; fixture mode retains
the exact recorded comparisons. These bounded calls prepare no index. Upstream errors and
mismatched provenance fail, never become `not_live`.

Both CDE identity/version and include families run anonymously. Their five sections come
from the data element API's DataElement response (ValueDomain, DataElementConcept,
AlternateNames and ClassificationSchemes), not CDE Match or the credentialed lists-of-values
API. The calls are unpinned registry reads; an explicit version is the CDE's own, never an
NCIt release or an export date, so these cases need no registry-release discovery. Operations
that need credentials remain fixture-only. This coverage does not certify all tool modes;
the report retains every fixture-only case as not run in live mode.

A test that passes against fixtures and fails live means a fixture is wrong (corrected by
re-recording, under change control) or the live service has changed: both are findings. One
that passes live and fails against fixtures means the server behaves differently against
different upstreams: a defect.

A run may begin with one operator-supplied prepare command, `NCI_SI_ACCEPTANCE_PREPARE`, a
shell command line run once, before the first test that starts a server, in the server's
environment against the ordinary fixtures (in live mode, the live services): the same settings
the server gets, its upstream base URLs and a fresh `NCI_SI_DATA_DIR`. The file that
`NCI_SI_ACCEPTANCE_INDEX_CODES` names holds the index set, one code per line: every concept the
fixture set records at an include that holds its summary. Every server then
starts from a copy of that data directory. A test marked `prepared` needs it and is NOT RUN
without the command; a command that fails, or whose requests find no fixture, fails every
dependent test with its reason. Other tests continue, including on parallel workers.
For this server it builds the interim NCIt index, in under a second and under a MB with the
default hashing embedder:

    NCI_SI_ACCEPTANCE_PREPARE='nci-si-mcp index-sample $(cat "$NCI_SI_ACCEPTANCE_INDEX_CODES")'

Run it only through the suite: the base URLs it is given name each surface of the fixture
server (`NCI_SI_EVS_BASE_URL` ends in `/evs`, to which the server adds `/api/v1/…` as it does to
the production host), and a command pointed at the fixture server's bare address finds no
fixture. Every setting the suite gives a server, and its format, is in the specification's §5
([`spec/acceptance.md`](../spec/acceptance.md)).

In fixture mode a test fails when one of its upstream requests found no fixture, and so does a
server whose requests while it starts found none: the server may treat the refusal as an outage
and still answer plausibly. A test that provokes such requests on purpose is marked
`unmatched_upstream`.

## Remote server

For this repository's prototype, `pdm run acceptance-http` supplies the local fixture server
settings, prepared index and restart hook automatically; see [transport details](../docs/transport.md).
Session-release cases marked `mcp_session` use handshake mode so they run in an actual MCP
session. Other cases negotiate normally: native list/resource cache fields belong to the
2026 protocol and are intentionally removed by the SDK on older protocols.

The platform's server is remote: `NCI_SI_ACCEPTANCE_URL` names its streamable-HTTP endpoint in
place of `NCI_SI_ACCEPTANCE_SERVER` (naming both stops the run). The harness starts nothing and
cannot set the environment of a process it did not start, so the operator does three things the
harness otherwise does: sets the server's upstream, changes its state for the tests that need a
server of their own, and prepares its index. Run it in one process: xdist workers together with
`NCI_SI_ACCEPTANCE_URL` are a usage error. The report records each run's transport, `stdio` or
`streamable-http`, in the JSON and in the rendered report.

The settings of a run, the probe that precedes the first test, the state hook's contract and the
index of a remote server are specified once, in the specification's §5
([Settings of a run](../spec/acceptance.md#settings-of-a-run) and the text after it); this README
does not repeat them. What the operator needs at a glance: set the fixture server's base URLs and
`NCI_SI_UPSTREAM_MODE` as the harness prints them, give the state hook for the tests that need a
server of their own (without it they count as not run, so their tool is never PASS), and prepare the
index and declare it with `NCI_SI_ACCEPTANCE_PREPARED=1`. A failed initial probe or state change
fails every dependent test; a failed scenario state change fails the test that needed it.
The endpoint wait ends at once on an HTTP 401 or 403. Failures retain their diagnostic reason,
with credentials withheld, rather than aborting the run or counting as `not_live`.

## The report

`--report` writes one JSON report per run; `nci_si_acceptance.report` renders it as the per-tool
table of the specification's §5. A tool is PASS, FAIL (a failed gate fails every tool), NO FIXTURE (a request lacked
a fixture: a question for the fixture set), INCOMPLETE (the tests that ran passed but some could
not run: a hardening candidate), NOT IMPLEMENTED, NOT RUN or NO TESTS; the module docstring
defines each, and each row counts the tests passed, failed, without a fixture and not run.
The rendered report opens with its title and the identity of the suite: the suite version, the
fixture-set version (the pinned release and the date of the latest recording) and the suite
digest. The title is ACCEPTANCE REPORT only when that digest is in `approved.yaml`; otherwise it
is MODIFIED, which is every report until the furnished tag. The JSON report carries the same
identity. Below the table it names the gates that failed and those that did not run, and gives the size
of the tools/list result in bytes, which every client session reads.
Combined with a live report, a tool that
passes against fixtures but fails live is PASS (fixture only) only when every failing live test
has a documented upstream limitation (`--limitations`, YAML of test id to requirement).

Each fresh report records `run.exit_status`, `run.selected` (the selected test count, agreed
by workers under xdist), `run.finished` (tests whose execution, including teardown, finished),
and `run.worker_crashes`. The shared report loader requires status 0 or 1, no worker crashes,
and equal selected, finished and recorded-outcome counts. Complete failing or skipped runs
are valid evidence; an early stop or recovered worker crash is not. Rendering, ratchet check
and update, live drift checking and the HTTP acceptance runner all use this guard. Reports
without these fields must be rerun. `--check-complete fixture` (or `live`) validates without
rendering; `--live live.json --drift` reports fixture passes that fail live and exits nonzero.
Combined rendering and drift require both reports to select the same test IDs from the same
suite; a complete subset cannot stand in for missing live evidence.

The frozen Phase 5 snapshots are the archival exception: `scripts/upstream_requirements.py`
checks their identical, nonempty 944-test sets and suite digest itself. Their historical JSON
is not given invented completion fields. This exception lasts for those recorded snapshots;
new snapshots must come from guarded runs and carry completion fields.

## CI: the ratchet on expected outcomes

The `acceptance` job of `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the suite in fixture mode against the
server built from the checkout (`pdm run acceptance -n 4 --report=fixture.json` with the prepare
step above), beside the `test` and `selftest` jobs and depending on none of them. Pytest's exit
status 0 and 1 are eligible, but the report must also prove completion; any other status or a
missing or incomplete report fails the job. The verdict
is the comparison with [`expected/fixture.json`](expected/fixture.json), which maps the id of
every test to its outcome (`passed`, `failed`, `no_fixture`, `skipped`, `not_implemented`,
`not_live`: the report's own vocabulary) and holds nothing else, so a reworded failure is not a
change. The job fails on any test with another outcome, any test the report lacks and any test
the expected outcomes lack, and writes the differences to its summary as a table of test,
expected and actual outcome. It stays green while tools are NOT IMPLEMENTED or FAIL, and fails
when a test of a tool that still fails stops passing, or starts to pass without anyone saying so.

A change that moves outcomes on purpose (a tool implemented, a test added or corrected) updates
the expected outcomes in the same pull request: run the suite as the job does, then
`pdm run acceptance-expected update acceptance/fixture.json`, and `pdm run acceptance-status` for
the README's table, which is generated from the expected outcomes and kept current by a
self-test. The diff of `expected/fixture.json` is what the review reads.

The job's summary holds the run's duration (a warning at 7 minutes of the 10 allowed: shard the
run before it grows into the limit) and the per-tool report; the artifact `acceptance-fixture`
keeps `fixture.json` and the rendered report for 30 days. A run on workers writes the report a
serial run writes: the controller process collects each test's tool, gate and outcome from the
reports its workers forward.

## The live workflow

`.github/workflows/acceptance-live.yml` runs by hand (`workflow_dispatch`) and every Monday at
06:41 UTC; the scheduled run fails when a test that passes on the fixtures fails live. It runs the
fixture suite and the live suite (`NCI_SI_ACCEPTANCE_MODE=live`, both with `-n 4`; the live
outcomes are not ratcheted), renders the combined report into the job summary and uploads
`fixture.json`, `live.json`, the rendered report and `network.md` as the artifact
`acceptance-live`. `network.md` records where the run came from: the runner's environment,
operating system, architecture and name, and whether EVS answers over IPv4 and over IPv6
(`curl -4` and `curl -6`, 10 seconds each; a failure is recorded and does not fail the job). The
repository secrets `NCI_SI_EVS_LICENSE_KEY` and `NCI_SI_CADSR_CREDENTIAL` are optional and reach
only the step that runs the live suite, and through it only the server under test: the harness
gives a server no other `NCI_SI_*` setting, and the credentials only in live mode. A secret that
is not set is unset in that step, not passed empty. A credential appears in no log, error or
result (requirement A7.5); `network.md` names which credentials were given, never a value.

## Layout

`src/nci_si_acceptance/` holds the harness: `client.py` starts the server or connects to it,
`remote.py` probes a remote server and runs the operator's state hook, `tools.py` calls the
required tools, `fixture_server.py` serves the fixtures (its docstring documents the format),
`report.py` writes and renders the per-tool report, `suite_identity.py` digests the suite and
decides whether a report is an acceptance report, `spec.py` reads the specification in
`../spec/` (the required tools among it), `requirements.py` checks the tests' citations of its
requirements, `document.py` renders it as `../docs/specification.md`, and `suite.py` holds the
rules of a run. `concepts.py` composes EVS concept answers from one recording per
concept, `record.py` records the set from live,
`craft.py` crafts the scenarios EVS does not produce on demand, `register.py` writes the
register of request forms (`request-forms/`), `expected.py` compares a report with the expected
outcomes (`expected/fixture.json`) and rewrites them, and `status.py` writes the README's status
table from them. `results.py` holds what the tests read from a tool's result and from the upstream
request log, and `stories.py` renders the domain-readable story of every test from `stories.yaml`.
`fixtures/` holds the fixtures ([fixtures/README.md](fixtures/README.md)), `tests/` the suite,
`selftests/` the tests of the harness itself.

The suite's version is the repository's nearest `vX.Y.Z` tag, derived at install time as the server's
is; the fixture set is versioned apart, by its pinned release and recording dates.

## Change control

The NCI SI MCP project coordinator is the code owner of `spec/` and `acceptance/`. From the
furnished tag, a change to `spec/` or to the suite needs the written approval of the branch chief
or a delegate ([spec/acceptance.md](../spec/acceptance.md)); a report from a changed suite renders
MODIFIED, because only the digests of approved releases, listed in
[approved.yaml](approved.yaml), make an acceptance report; and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
records each approved change with the requirement it serves.

The digest covers `tests/`, `fixtures/` with the manifest, `request-forms/`, `src/`, `pyproject.toml`
(the pytest configuration and the dependency pins decide what runs) and `../spec/`; it leaves out
the self-tests, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` (a record that carries release digests), caches, editor
and system litter, `approved.yaml` and the server under test, so one approved suite attests any
server (`src/nci_si_acceptance/suite_identity.py` defines the set). A symbolic link among the
digested files, or a root that lacks any of them, is an error, never a partial digest.

What the check is and is not:

- It is a tripwire, not tamper-proofing. `approved.yaml` changes by review by the NCI SI MCP
  project coordinator, and the report's identity block is self-stated.
- Approval is attested on a clean checkout, since untracked files inside the digested paths count.
- Reports are written outside the digested paths (as `--report=fixture.json` in `acceptance/`
  already is); the digest is taken when the run starts, from the checkout the run is in, and a run
  against a harness installed from another checkout is refused.
- The suite version in the report comes from install metadata (the nearest tag), so run
  `pdm install` after a tag. The digest alone decides approval.

## Secured caller fixtures

The additive X-25–X-28 cases use `NCI_SI_ACCEPTANCE_SECURITY_SERVER`, an operator-supplied
command that starts a loopback HTTP server. The furnished repository's CI and HTTP gate supply `scripts/permissions_fixture.py`. For a
local fixture run set `NCI_SI_ACCEPTANCE_SECURITY_SERVER='python ../scripts/permissions_fixture.py'`
alongside the preparation environment. Successors provide their own adapter;
the suite imports no prototype code. Without an adapter these cases explicitly report NOT RUN.
They are fixture-only, not evidence of production identity or revocation behavior.

The adapter receives the normal fixture upstream environment plus `NCI_SI_TEST_HTTP_PORT`
and `NCI_SI_TEST_AUTHORITY_FILE`. The JSON file contains generated `tokens` keyed by fixture
actor and `policies` containing each actor's `capabilities` (tool names) and Unix-second
`expires_at`. Missing policy denies. The adapter authenticates tokens, reloads policy on each
request, binds only loopback, and exposes `/mcp`, `/health` and `/ready`. A request to `/mcp`
without a valid token is answered 401 with `Cache-Control: no-store` and a `WWW-Authenticate`
header, and calls to `/mcp` that return content or discovery (X-27) carry `Cache-Control: no-store`.
`/health` and `/ready` answer `{"status": "ok"}` and `{"status": "ready"}` with `no-store`, and a
request whose `Host` is not the adapter's own is answered 421 (X-28). The harness owns and reaps the
process; test tokens are never production credentials and must not appear in logs. This is a
test-adapter contract, not a proposed production policy format or identity-provider choice.
