"""The run of the suite: the server under test, its upstream, scenarios, and the request log.

A test that selects scenarios (`@pytest.mark.scenario("release/unknown")`) gets a
server process of its own, started with the scenarios active and with their
settings, so that nothing the server keeps between calls outlives them. Requests a
server makes while it starts must find fixtures too.

Against a remote server (`NCI_SI_ACCEPTANCE_URL`) the harness starts no process: a probe makes
sure the server answers and reaches the fixture server before the first test, and the operator's
state-change hook, where there is one, gives a scenario set's tests, and each `own_server` test,
the state they need; without it those tests are skipped. A remote server's prepare step is
the operator's (`NCI_SI_ACCEPTANCE_PREPARED`).

The operator's prepare command, where one is given, runs once, before the first test that
starts a server, in the server's environment, with the codes of the index set listed in the file
`NCI_SI_ACCEPTANCE_INDEX_CODES` names; every server then starts from a copy of the data
directory it produced. A prepare command that fails, or whose requests find no fixture,
fails every test that depends on it, without aborting unrelated tests.
