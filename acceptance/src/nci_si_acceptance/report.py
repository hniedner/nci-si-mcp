"""The per-tool report (docs/specification.md §5).

A run of the suite writes one report per run mode (`pytest --report=PATH`), with the
final outcome of every test, the transport of the run (stdio, or streamable-http for a remote
server) and the identity of the suite (suite_identity.py). A test counts for
the tool its `tool` marker names; a test marked `gate` gates every tool (§4). One run gives
each required tool one outcome:

    PASS             every test of the tool ran and passed, and every gate
    FAIL             a test of the tool failed, or a gate did (shown as "gates only")
    NO FIXTURE       the tool's tests failed only because a request found no fixture:
                     a question for the fixture set, not a defect of the server
    INCOMPLETE       the tool's tests that ran passed, but some could not run: skipped, or
                     needing a capability the tool lacks; a hardening
                     candidate, not a pass
    NOT IMPLEMENTED  the server does not expose the required tool name
    NOT RUN          no test of the tool ran (in live mode: none is live-capable)
    NO TESTS         the suite has no test for the tool: a defect of the suite

In a live run, the tests that run in fixture mode only leave a tool NOT RUN, never INCOMPLETE.

Combining the fixture run with the live run gives the final outcome. A tool that
passes against fixtures is PASS (fixture only) when each of its live failures is a
test with a documented upstream limitation, and FAIL otherwise; a gate that fails live
fails every tool in the same way. Limitations are documented per test, in YAML:
`<test id>: <upstream requirement>`.

    python -m nci_si_acceptance.report fixture.json [--live live.json] [--limitations FILE]

PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE: the suite's conftest imports this plugin before pytest could
rewrite its assertions, and it has none.
