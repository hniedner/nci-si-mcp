# Governed HTTP access

This is portable integration support with fixture evidence. Production identity and Cloud One
deployment remain **disabled and unvalidated** until the security/hosting owners approve them.

The stock entry point uses one `/mcp` endpoint. Local development defaults to `trusted-local`.
For a governed deployment set `NCI_SI_HTTP_AUTH_MODE=required` and
`NCI_SI_HTTP_AUTH_FACTORY=approved_package:integration`, then run
`nci-si-mcp serve --transport streamable-http`. The factory is trusted, installed Python code:
only the operator may configure it. An absent or incomplete integration fails before listening.
Required HTTP configuration cannot silently launch unrestricted stdio.

The factory receives `Settings` and returns `HTTPAuthIntegration(auth, token_verifier,
authority_resolver)` from `nci_si_mcp.http_auth`. It supplies:

- SDK `AuthSettings` with the approved issuer, resource-server audience, required transport
  scopes, and `validate_token_resource=True`.
- An SDK `TokenVerifier` implementation using the approved provider/library to verify tokens.
  It must return the verified issuer in `claims['iss']`, subject, client, resource and finite
  expiry. If tenant applies, normalize its verified value to `claims['tenant']`.
- An asynchronous policy resolver returning the immutable authority described in
  [caller permissions](caller-permissions.md). Its principal must exactly match that verified
  token's issuer, subject, tenant and client. Missing/mismatched policy denies access.

The module does not implement OAuth or JWT cryptography. It additionally checks issuer and
expiry; the SDK checks resource audience and scopes. Missing/invalid credentials produce 401,
insufficient transport scopes 403, and operation/policy refusals `permission_denied`. No inbound
token is forwarded to EVS, caDSR or Shared SI; their service credentials remain separately
configured and origin-bound. Service credentials do not establish caller delegation.

`/health` and `/ready` are public status-only probes, still protected by configured Host/Origin
admission. All governed HTTP responses are `Cache-Control: no-store`. Forwarded identity headers
grant no authority; Uvicorn proxy-header interpretation stays off. Set the actual external
Host/Origin allowlists. An approved TLS/network proxy must pass bearer authentication through;
this implementation does not accept proxy assertions of user identity.
Deployment also needs [gateway limits and timeouts, and network egress controls](container.md#gateway-controls-and-outbound-access);
authentication alone does not provide these controls.

    participant C as MCP client
    participant L as Load balancer
    participant A as Replica A
    participant B as Replica B
    participant V as Approved verifier and policy
    C->>L: Authenticated request
    L->>A: New or A-owned session
    A->>V: Verify token and refresh policy
    V-->>A: Bound identity and capabilities
    A-->>C: Permitted result, private/no-store
    C->>L: Known A session ID
    L->>B: Incorrect routing or A restarted
    B-->>C: Session not found (404)
    Note over C,B: Client authenticates and initializes a new session
```

Stateful sessions and their first implicit NCIt release belong to one process. The load balancer
must keep known session IDs on their owner. Another replica or a restarted owner returns 404;
it does not silently recreate the old pin. A different principal cannot reuse the session.
An explicit release does not change its implicit pin. Security configuration changes require
session invalidation and client reauthentication.

Stateless and the SDK's single-exchange requests hold no multi-call pin: each request verifies
authority and resolves an omitted release. Supply an explicit release for a consistent task
across calls or replicas. There are no alternate MCP endpoints or cross-endpoint session IDs.

For rollback, retain required mode and the approved integration. Do not roll a secured service
back to a version that lacks this startup guard; keep it unavailable or maintain an independently
approved authentication boundary. Never restore availability by switching to trusted-local.

Before production enablement the owner must approve issuer/audience, tenant/client mapping,
capabilities, transport scopes, revocation freshness, provider secrets and retention, TLS/proxy
trust and routing. Local doubles and fixture upstreams validate mechanics only; they do not
establish production identity or live caDSR readiness.
