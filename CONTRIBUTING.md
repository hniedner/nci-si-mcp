# Contributing

How to work on this repository. What it is, and its status, is in [README.md](README.md); how to
install and run the server is in [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md); how it is built is in
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md). Update the documents and diagrams with each behaviour change:
the [documentation website](docs/documentation-site.md) is built from these sources (pinned build,
local preview, reviewed page allowlist, source and version labels).

## Set up

You need Python 3.14 or newer and [PDM](https://pdm-project.org).

```bash
pdm install                    # .venv from pdm.lock, with the test and lint tools and the server and index extras
pdm run pre-commit install     # run the gates on every commit
```

| `pdm run quickstart-tools` | Regenerate the table of tools in [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) from `spec/tools.yaml`; `--check` verifies it |
| `pandoc -f gfm docs/specification.md -o specification.docx` | The Word copy of the specification, a build product: never committed or edited |

Beyond the server and the suite, the repository holds the documentation site, the validation
companion and the benchmark tooling; these are their entry points.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `pdm run docs-build` | Build the documentation website into `tmp/docs-site` ([documentation site](docs/documentation-site.md)) |
| `pdm run portal` | Serve the local validation dashboard on loopback ([local validation](docs/local-validation.md)) |
| `pdm run operator-worker` | Run one validation job (acceptance or benchmark) the way the dashboard does, from the command line |
| `pdm run benchmark-http` | HTTP transport measurements of the served tools ([method and evidence](docs/benchmark.md)) |

The server tests are `unittest.TestCase` classes, run by pytest. They are offline:
`tests/fakes.py` supplies shared doubles, and client integration tests use local HTTP fixtures.
The acceptance suite and its self-tests use pytest directly.

## Test levels

The [behavioural story catalogue](docs/behavioural-tests.md) documents every MCP acceptance
case for domain reviewers. Keep its authored narratives and function assignments in
`acceptance/stories.yaml` aligned with test changes, then run `pdm run acceptance-stories`.
`pdm run acceptance-stories --check` verifies completeness and freshness; the harness
self-tests enforce the same check in CI.

Give each behavior an owning test at the interface its caller uses. Keep component tests
for independent contracts and broader tests for distinct integration failures; do not repeat
the same claim at every layer. Describe Given/When/Then before implementation, observe the
intended failure, and remove redundant development scaffolding with evidence before landing.
The outside-in review rules are in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#outside-in-test-design-and-review).
This preserves the
[test pyramid](https://testing.googleblog.com/2015/04/just-say-no-to-more-end-to-end-tests.html);
parameterized contract cases do not need an arbitrary ratio of test counts.

| Level | What exercises it here |
| --- | --- |
| Unit | Parsers, validation, ranking, truncation and report verdicts in `tests/` and `acceptance/selftests/` |
| Integration | Real SQLite migrations/builds/rollback, HTTP retries against local servers, and owned subprocess cleanup |
| API | The real MCP client in `tests/test_server.py`; HTTP authentication, sessions and health in `tests/test_transport.py` |
| End to end | Prepared fixture acceptance through the real stdio server; `pdm run acceptance-http` through a listening HTTP server; the CI container smoke through the built image, external model/index, readiness and graceful shutdown |

The companion follows the same pyramid: unit tests verify evidence projection, historical
story mapping, proposals and rendering; real SQLite/filesystem/subprocess tests verify import,
atomic history and bounded worker lifecycle; loopback HTTP tests verify controls and error
responses. The `companion containers (amd64)` CI job builds both images and exercises a real
fixture benchmark, result display, network/mount isolation and shutdown independence.
Automated Chromium journeys cover responsive search, requirement links, result filtering and
native run/cancel forms. The worker is controlled in the browser tests; separate integration
tests exercise real worker termination. See the
[assurance record](docs/government-site-assurance.md#automated-browser-regression-journeys)
for setup commands, manual checks and limitations.

Coverage includes lines, branches and Python subprocesses for the server and harness suites.
It identifies execution gaps, not missing assertions: use a targeted mutation when an
assertion's sensitivity is uncertain. Image-only checks run in the container CI job. The
fixtures verify contracts, including crafted caDSR responses; they do not establish live
upstream support. Some caDSR endpoints permit anonymous access; protected endpoints require
issued credentials. The separate live workflow checks only cases marked `live_capable` and
does not treat skipped cases as drift. It covers protocol/discovery, selected local validation
and unavailable-capability contracts, and bounded EVS, anonymous CDE and cross-domain content
checks; [the suite README](acceptance/README.md#writing-a-test) maintains the exact live scope.
Validation refusals are not evidence of working upstream retrieval; credentials alone do not
enable the fixture-only cases. This remains limited live coverage, not full content conformance.

On pull requests, `scripts/ci_images.py` skips an image job only when every changed path
is a known noninput for that image. Unknown paths, an empty or unavailable diff, and all
pushes to `main` select both image jobs. The event's full base/head change set includes
deleted paths and both sides of renames; test-only changes can avoid image builds, while
public documentation remains a companion-image input. Other CI gates are unchanged.

## Coverage badges

CI exports separate JSON coverage reports for the server and the complete, combined harness
self-tests. After every CI gate passes on a push to `main`, the badge job writes measured
line-plus-branch percentages and their source counts, commit and run URL to the dedicated
`coverage-badges` branch. It never commits to `main`, publishes from a PR, or replaces data
from a newer main commit with an older run. Failed runs leave the previous measurements
visible; use the adjacent CI badge to see main's current status.

The README uses [Shields endpoint badges](https://shields.io/badges/endpoint-badge), so no
coverage-service account, extra credential or manual percentage update is needed. GitHub and
Shields cache images, so a successful publication may take a few minutes to appear. Before
the first successful publication, the endpoints do not exist. Do not delete `coverage-badges`
during feature-branch cleanup; it is generated publication data.

## Standards

1. **Stay on the goal.** A change does what its task asks.
2. **Tests are written for their value.** Each one checks behaviour that a user or a caller can
   observe, and can fail when that behaviour breaks.
3. **Coverage: 90% is the checked minimum, above 95% is the aim.** The gap is deliberate: it
   keeps anyone from writing tests for the number. Cover untested behaviour whenever you can.
   Never add a test that asserts nothing, or only that a mock was called.
   The figure covers `src/` and every script in `scripts/` except those `omit`ted in
   `pyproject.toml`, each with its reason there; omit nothing to raise the number.
4. **Keep it simple, and say each thing once.** Follow the structure in ARCHITECTURE.md: thin
   adapters over the service, one error path, closed value sets in `validation.py`. No
   abstraction for a single use.
5. **Write code to be read.** Small functions, names that say what a thing is, comments that
   give the reason.
6. **Remove dead code** in the change that makes it dead.
7. **Keep the documentation in step, and short.** Update it in the same change. The README
   answers the first questions and links onward; details belong in the deeper documents.

## The gates

Pre-commit runs every gate except the last three on the files of a commit, and CI runs the same hooks
on all files. The tests run in CI and with `pdm run test`. A gate that fails is fixed, not
skipped (`--no-verify` and `SKIP=` are not used).

| Gate | What it enforces |
| --- | --- |
| Ruff format and lint | Style, imports, likely bugs, security patterns, a bare `print` outside the gate scripts, a broad `except` that neither passes the exception on nor logs the traceback |
| basedpyright | Types, over `src`, `scripts` and `acceptance/src` |
| Complexity | Every function below cyclomatic complexity 8, nested ones and the tests included (`scripts/validation/check_complexity.py`) |
| Test quality | No test without an assertion, or with only mock or `callable` assertions (`scripts/validation/check_test_quality.py`) |
| Dead code | No unused functions, classes or variables (vulture) |
| gitleaks, zizmor | No secrets; safe GitHub Actions workflows |
| Upstream requirement packages | `docs/upstream/*.md` are the current render of `docs/upstream/catalogue.yaml` (`scripts/upstream_requirements.py --check`) |
| Acceptance ratchet (CI) | Every test of the acceptance suite, in fixture mode, has the outcome in `acceptance/expected/fixture.json`. A change that moves an outcome on purpose updates that file in the same pull request, and the diff of the file is what the review reads: `pdm run acceptance-expected update acceptance/fixture.json` writes it from a fresh report, and `pdm run acceptance-status` the README table that follows |
| Tests and coverage | The suite passes; CI fails below the coverage minimum of standard 3 and warns when the aim is missed |
| Dependency audit (CI only) | No runtime dependency with a known vulnerability (pip-audit over the server and embeddings extras, on every change and weekly); no pull request bringing one in at high severity (dependency review). Dependabot proposes updates of the workflows' actions; [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) says how to report a vulnerability |

A finding is fixed in the code. Where a rule does not fit, it is suppressed as narrowly as
possible (a line, then a file or a directory, then the project, in `pyproject.toml`), with the
reason beside the suppression, or once in the module when it repeats.

## Pull requests and releases

Every change reaches `main` through a pull request that is squash-merged. The pull request
title becomes the commit subject, and the next version is computed from it, so the title is a
[Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) subject. A check on the pull request
fails otherwise. Changes to `spec/` and `acceptance/` follow the change control in
[acceptance/README.md](acceptance/README.md#change-control): the NCI SI MCP project coordinator is
their code owner.

| Title | Release (while the version is below 1.0) |
| --- | --- |
| `feat: …` | Minor: 0.3.1 → 0.4.0 |
| `fix: …`, `perf: …` | Patch: 0.3.1 → 0.3.2 |
| `!` after the type, as in `feat!: …` | Minor |
| `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `build`, `ci`, `revert`, `security`, `deprecate` | None |

A scope is optional, in lower case: `fix(index): …`. Choose the type with care, because it
decides the version. Only the title counts: the squash commit has no body, so mark a breaking
change with `!`, and do not edit the commit message in the merge dialog.

When CI passes on `main`, the release workflow tags that commit `vX.Y.Z` and creates a GitHub
release. Nothing else is needed: no file holds the version, and the workflow never commits to
`main`. If a release is missing although `main` is green, start the Release workflow by hand
(`gh workflow run release.yml`). Version 1.0.0 is tagged by hand.

For the complete fixture ratchet, supply the furnished secured adapter explicitly:
`NCI_SI_ACCEPTANCE_SECURITY_SERVER='python ../scripts/permissions_fixture.py'` alongside the
index preparation environment. CI sets this for this checkout; successors must supply their
own adapter. Without it the secured cases report NOT RUN, not a security pass.
