"""What a tool parameter means, stated next to the parameter in the handler signature.

The core package has no dependencies, so a signature cannot carry pydantic's `Field`. It carries
`Described` metadata in `Annotated[...]` instead; `server.py` turns it into the description and
the schema keywords of the served input schema, and the CLI ignores it. The nested records of an
argument (TypedDicts) are described with `describe_fields`, which the server adds to the schema.
